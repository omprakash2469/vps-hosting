Add your user (in this case, ec2-user) to the apache group.
	- sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user

Log out and then log back in again to pick up the new group, and then verify your membership.

To verify your membership in the apache group, reconnect to your instance, and then run the following command:
	- groups

Change the group ownership of /var/www and its contents to the apache group.
	- sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www

To add group write permissions and to set the group ID on future subdirectories, change the directory permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories.
	- sudo chmod 2775 /var/www && find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;

To add group write permissions, recursively change the file permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories:
	- find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
